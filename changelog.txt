CHANGELOG

Additions:
+ Added Pillory block, a new restraint that handcuffed players can be detained in.
+ Added Captive Tag, a type of nametag that can be applied to players, changing their display name.
+ Added the ability to break out of handcuff by spamming left and right movement keys, can be disabled in config.
+ Added config options for enabling/disabling the interuption phase while getting handcuffed
+ Added statistics for the following:
  - Times Handcuffed
  - Players Handcuffed
  - Time Spent Handcuffed
  - Handcuffs Broken Out Of
  - Handcuffs Interupted
  - Time Spent Lockpicking
  - Lockpicks Broken
  - Successful Lockpicks
+ Added handuffed animations, and variants for the various states of being handcuffed (IE: soft-cuffed, detained, anchored).

Fixes:
- Reworked Config Schema, configs are now .json files and are more reliable.
  (!) All old configs will not apply to this version and above, and must be re-configured.
- Reworked Command Syntax, cleaned and fixed up /handcuff (and changed it to /handcuffs) to make it more reliable and user-freindly.
- Handcuffed players no longer break out of their handcuffs when disconnecting.
- Anchored players remain anchored when disconnecting.
- Handcuffed players can no longer scroll in their hotbar with the number keys.
- Handcuffed players can now be targetted by mobs.
- Make padlock hitbox shorter for easier access to locked blocks.
- Fix Cell Doors dropping 2 Cell Door items instead of 1.
- Padlocks now drop a padlock item when breaking with no block under it. 
- Removed many unneccessary log spamming, mostly left-over from debugging.
